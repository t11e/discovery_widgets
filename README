A suite of Ajax search widgets to interface with the Discovery Engine.

Discovery Widgets provides a set of JavaScript widgets that enable a
highly-responsive Ajax based search interface. They are comprised of
UI widgets, a page controller, and other infrastructure. The UI
widgets are built using the jQuery framework.

The page controller uses a RESTful API with regular URL parameters for
the request and expect a JSON response. Some widgets expect Discovery
Engine specific response data.

We use a pub/sub notification system for communication decoupling the
widgets from the main page controller logic. This is similar to the
system described at http://www.openajax.org but it currently uses
synchronous event callbacks.

To see the widgets in action run

    ant compress-media server

To generate jsdoc documentation for the widgets, run

    ant jsdoc

Then point your browser at http://localhost:8080.

Note that you can override what port the server uses. For example:

    ant -Dserver.port=8888 compress-media server

A PHP example is also included that can be viewed if the src/web directory is
deployed inside the docroot of a Web server with PHP configured.
